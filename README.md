This Github repository contains a Tensorlab tutorial as Jupyter notebook. 

Tensorlab is a MATLAB toolbox for tensor computations. You can download Tensorlab at
 
        https://www.tensorlab.net

Tensorlab requires MATLAB 7.9 (R2009b) or higher. To get MATLAB running in jupyter notebook follow the [guide](https://anneurai.net/2015/11/12/matlab-based-ipython-notebooks/) by [Anne Urai](https://anneurai.net). As of August 2018 this did not work with Python 3.6, but it did work with Python 3.5. Here is a [guide](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html#using-a-different-version-of-python) on how to switch between different Python version.
    

This tutorial is inspired by the Tensorlab online manual and the Tensorlab Demos available at
